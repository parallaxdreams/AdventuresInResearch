			<h2><span class="mw-headline">Basic Help for Adventures in Research!</span></h2> 
			<p>To advance through the game, <tt>left-click</tt> or press the <tt>space</tt> or <tt>enter</tt> keys. When at a menu, <tt>left-click</tt> to make a choice, or use the arrow keys to select a choice and <tt>enter</tt> to activate it.</p> 
		<p><a name="Game_Menu" id="Game_Menu"></a></p> 
			<h3><span class="mw-headline">Game Menu</span></h3> 
			<p>When playing a game, click the Settings Icon or press the <tt>escape</tt> key to enter the game menu. The game menu gives the following choices:</p> 
			<dl> 
				<dt>Back</dt> 
					<dd>Returns to the game.</dd> 
				<dt>Save Game</dt> 
					<dd>Allows you to save a game by clicking on a save slot. You have three slots available to save your game. You should save your game often so that you don't lose progress.</dd> 
				<dt>Load Game</dt> 
					<dd>Allows you to load a game by clicking on a save slot.
						<dl>
							<dt>Your Saved Games</dt>
							<dd>The saved games that you created.</dd>
							<dt>Auto Saved Games</dt>
							<dd>These saved games are automatically created at regular intervals by the computer. They are to be used for emergency purposes only: If your game crashes, it may be possible to use one of these auto saves to resume the game close to where you left off.</dd>
							<dt>Act Selection</dt>
							<dd>From this screen you can restart any unlocked Act from the game. This is helpful if you want to review what was covered in, say, Act Four without having to restart the game, or keep a saved game from the beginning of that Act. Acts are unlocked as you progress through the game.</dd>
						</dl>
					</dd>
				<dt>Settings</dt> 
					<dd>Changes the game settings (options):
						<dl>
							<dt>Display</dt>
							<dd>Switches between fullscreen and windowed mode.</dd> 
							<dt>Text Speed</dt> 
							<dd>Controls the rate at which text displays. The further to the right this slider is, the faster the text will display. All the way to the right causes text to be shown instantly.</dd> 
							<dt>Sound FX and Music Volume</dt> 
							<dd>Controls the volume of the Sound effects and Music channels, respectively. The farther to the right these are, the louder the volume.</dd>
						</dl>
					</dd>
				<dt>Achievements</dt>
					<dd>Shows all of the Achievements you have earned while playing the game. Click the arrows on the left and right sides of this screen to see additional Achievements.</dd>
				<dt>Help</dt> 
					<dd>Shows this help screen.</dd> 
				<dt>Quit</dt> 
					<dd>Exits the game; the game will be closed and ended. You will lose any unsaved progress, so make sure to save your game before quitting.</dd> 
			</dl> 
		<p><a name="Keyboard_and_Mouse_Controls" id="Keyboard_and_Mouse_Controls"></a></p> 
			<h3><span class="mw-headline">Keyboard and Mouse Controls</span></h3> 
			<dl> 
				<dt>Left-click, Enter</dt> 
					<dd>Advances through the game, activates menu choices, buttons, and sliders</dd>

				<dt>Tab</dt> 
					<dd>Toggles skipping, causing it to occur until <tt>tab</tt> is pressed again</dd> 
				<dt>Left Arrow, PageUp</dt> 
					<dd>Causes rollback to occur. Rollback reverses the game back in time, showing prior text and even allowing menu choices to be changed.</dd> 
				<dt>Right Arrow, PageDown</dt> 
					<dd>Causes rollforward to occur, cancelling out a previous rollback.</dd> 
				<dt>Settings Icon, Escape</dt>

					<dd>Takes a screenshot, saving it in a file named <tt>screenshotxxxx.png</tt>, where <tt>xxxx</tt> is a serial number</dd>
				<dt>V</dt>
					<dd>Enables self-voicing mode. In this mode menus, dialogue, and other game text will be read-aloud by the voice defined in your Operating System's settings. When in self-voicing mode, keyboard navigation is changed so that the up and down arrow keys will iterate through all menu choices, buttons, and windows on the screen. For platform-specific information about changing voice settings, please see the following:
						<dl>
							<dt>Windows</dt>
								<dd>On Windows, the game uses the Microsoft Speech API. Speech synthesis settings can be changed on the "Text to Speech" tab of the "Speech Recognition" control panel.</dd>
							<dt>Mac OS X</dt>
								<dd>On Mac OS X, the game uses the <em>say</em> command. Speech synthesis settings can be changed on the "Text to Speech" tab of the "Dictation &amp; Speech" panel in System Preferences.</dd>
						</dl>
					</dd>
				<dt>Alt-F4, Command-Q</dt> 
					<dd>Quits the game</dd> 
				<dt>Delete</dt>
